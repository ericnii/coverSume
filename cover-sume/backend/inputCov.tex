Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer role at Google. As an HBSc in Computer Science student at the University of Toronto with experience in both academic and real-world technical environments, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills to your team.

During my time at the University of Toronto, I have developed a solid foundation in full stack development through coursework and projects using technologies such as React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. Beyond academics, I've applied these skills by building projects such as a personal portfolio website showcasing responsive design and interactive features. These experiences honed my problem-solving abilities and reinforced my passion for efficient and scalable software solutions.

My work experience has also equipped me with strong teamwork and communication skills. As a Frontend Developer at SpurHacks, I led a team to develop a seamless interface improving user engagement. Additionally, my leadership role in student organizations reflects my ability to take initiative and thrive in team environments.

I am particularly drawn to Googleâ€™s focus on innovation and its commitment to creating cutting-edge technology. I would welcome the chance to contribute to your innovative work while continuing to grow as a developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and would be happy to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely, \\
Eric Ni
