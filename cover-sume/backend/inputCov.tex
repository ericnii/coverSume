Dear Johnny Chen,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer role at Google. As a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto with extensive hands-on experience in web development and user interface design, I am thrilled by the possibility of contributing my skills to your team.

During my time at university, I have developed a solid foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern web frameworks through coursework and personal projects. Beyond academics, I have applied these skills by developing a personal portfolio website using React.js, which honed my problem-solving abilities and reinforced my passion for creating dynamic and responsive web interfaces.

My work experience has also equipped me with strong collaboration and communication skills. As a Marketing Competitor at DECA, I developed strategies under tight deadlines, and as a Warehouse Associate at PCF Souvenirs, I led a team to exceed productivity goals. These roles reflect my ability to work efficiently in team environments and adapt to challenging situations.

I am particularly drawn to Google's focus on innovation and user experience. I would welcome the chance to contribute to your cutting-edge projects while continuing to grow as a skilled developer in a visionary company.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and would be happy to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely, \\
Eric Ni
