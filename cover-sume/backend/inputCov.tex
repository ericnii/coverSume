\noindent Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to express my interest in the \textbf{Coding and Debugging} position at Safuture. As a Computer Science student from the University of Toronto with a strong foundation in software and web development, I am eager to contribute to your team and further develop my skills in a dynamic environment.

My experience aligns well with the requirements outlined in the job posting. I have a proven track record in software development, particularly with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, and Angular. My familiarity with the Angular Framework and proficiency in Python and C\# for backend development make me a strong candidate for this role. Additionally, I have experience with the MVC design model and have developed mobile applications using Android Studio.

During my internship at MarkiTech.AI, I honed my skills in managing database systems and maintaining operating systems. I also gained experience in editing source-code, profiling and analyzing algorithms, and implementing build systems. My role required strong communication and collaboration skills, which I developed through working in Agile environments and serving as a Scrum Master.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work at Safuture, where I can apply my technical skills to troubleshoot system errors, write computer instructions, and provide tech support. I am also keen to explore the optional asset of GIS knowledge, which I believe could add value to your projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can contribute to the innovative work at Safuture.

\noindent Eric Ni
