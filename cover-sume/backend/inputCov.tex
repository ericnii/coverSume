Dear John,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer role at Google. As a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto with experience in both academic and real-world technical environments, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills to your team.

During my time at the university, I have developed a solid foundation in software development through various projects and coursework. Beyond academics, I've applied these skills by building projects such as CoverSume and a Personal Portfolio Website. These experiences honed my problem-solving abilities and reinforced my passion for coding and web development.

My work experience has also equipped me with strong collaboration and communication skills. As a Frontend Developer at SpurHacks, I developed a seamless frontend interface focusing on user-friendly design and efficient code. Additionally, my experience as a Warehouse Associate reflects my ability to take initiative and thrive in team environments.

I am particularly drawn to Google's focus on innovation and technology excellence. I would welcome the chance to contribute to your innovative work while continuing to grow as a developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and would be happy to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely, \\
Eric Ni
