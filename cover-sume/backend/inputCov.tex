\noindent Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to express my interest in the \textbf{Software Developer} position at Safuture. With a strong background in software and web development, I am eager to contribute to your team and help drive innovative solutions.

My experience aligns well with the requirements outlined in the job description. I have proven expertise in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, and Angular, and I am familiar with the Angular Framework. My proficiency in Python and C\# for backend development, along with my understanding of the MVC design model, equips me to handle complex coding and debugging tasks effectively.

During my time at MarkiTech.AI, I developed full-stack applications and managed database systems, which honed my skills in designing and testing computer structures. Additionally, my experience with Android Studio for mobile application development and knowledge of GIS, though optional, adds value to my technical repertoire.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on coding, debugging, and troubleshooting system errors at Safuture. I am confident that my strong communication and collaboration skills will enable me to work effectively within your team and contribute to maintaining and enhancing operating systems.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team. I have attached my resume for your review.

\noindent Sincerely,\\[0.5em]
\noindent Eric Ni
