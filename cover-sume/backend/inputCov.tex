\noindent Dear Clara Wu,

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to express my interest in the \textbf{.NET} position at cwdcwdcdw. As a Computer Science student from the University of Toronto with a strong foundation in software development and experience in .NET technologies, I am eager to contribute to your team and further develop my skills in a dynamic environment.

During my time at MarkiTech.AI, I gained hands-on experience in building scalable web applications using Node.js and Express, which has equipped me with a solid understanding of backend development. My familiarity with Agile methodologies and experience as a Scrum Master have honed my ability to collaborate effectively in team settings, ensuring smooth project execution and delivery.

I am particularly drawn to cwdcwdcdw's commitment to innovation and excellence in software solutions. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in .NET development to contribute to your projects and support your mission of delivering high-quality software products.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in software development can be an asset to cwdcwdcdw.
